This repository is designed to help manage Linux servers and simplify common tasks. I hope you find this code useful, and if you do, please consider giving it a star!

Note: My Linux is Alma Linux that same distro with CentOs, RedHat and if you use other linux such as Debian or Ubuntu you need to config some file when you want to use this file. In this repo, when you run any file, the firewall alway turn off for config easy. If you want to turn on firewall you need to config firewall port for any feature below.

Features:
1. Firewall management (turn on, turn off, check status)
2. DNS configuration (created forward zone for domain name with ip address)
3. Web server configuration (create web folder for multiple domain)
4. FTP server configuration (create ftp folder by username)
